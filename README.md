### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eason and I'm a full stack developer and smart contract creator on Ethereum! [![Ethereum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easonchai/easonchai/main/src/ethereum.png)](https://ethereum.org/en/) <br />
I'm currently working on Decentramall, a decentralized shopping mall built on both IPFS & Ethereum. It uses a unique ERC721 minting process and is based on a Sigmoid bonding curve, which I wrote about [here](https://medium.com/@easonchaijw/an-actual-sigmoid-function-in-solidity-6b78d002d8be)!
