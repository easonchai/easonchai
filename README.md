### Hey There! 👋

My name is Eason and I'm a Full Stack Developer and Smart Contract creator on Ethereum! [![Ethereum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easonchai/easonchai/main/src/ethereum.png)](https://ethereum.org/en/) <br />
I'm currently working on 🛍️ **Decentramall**, a decentralized shopping mall built on both IPFS & Ethereum. It uses a unique ERC721 minting process and is based on a Sigmoid bonding curve, which I wrote about [here](https://medium.com/@easonchaijw/an-actual-sigmoid-function-in-solidity-6b78d002d8be)!

### 💻 Technologies
Lately, I work primarily with React & Solidity, while learning new tools and tricks such as React Native, and ☁️ Google Cloud! I'm also looking to learn more about ML and AI as well, so do reach out to me about it! 😉 Blockchain, DeFi & Ethereum are kinda my thing, so feel free to ask me about those too! 💬

### 🧑🏿‍🤝‍🧑🏽 Community Work
Recently did two workshops, one for Hacktoberfest 2020 and another for Python under Sunway Tech Club. It was a super fun experience, being able to teach the public more about OSS as well as creating useful projects with Python. I'm definitely looking forward to more events 😄.
